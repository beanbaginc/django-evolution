version 0.6.9 (13-March-2013):
	* Django Evolution no longer applies upgrades that match the current state.

	  When upgrading an old database, where a new model has been introduced
	  and evolutions were added on that model, Django Evolution would try to
	  apply the mutations after creating that baseline, resulting in
	  confusing errors.

	  Now we only apply mutations for parts of the database that differ
	  between the last stored signature and the new signature. It should
	  fix a number of problems people have hit when upgrading extremely
	  old databases.


version 0.6.8 (8-February-2013):
	* Added two new management commands: list-evolutions and wipe-evolution.

	  list-evolutions lists all applied evolutions. It can take one or more
	  app labels, and will restrict the output to those apps.

	  wipe-evolution will wipe one or more evolutions from the database. This
	  should only be used if absolutely necessary, and can cause problems. It
	  is useful if there's some previously applied evolutions getting in the
	  way, which can happen if a person is uncareful with downgrading and
	  upgrading again.


version 0.6.7 (12-April-2012):
	* Don't fail when an app doesn't contain any models.

	  Installing a baseline for apps without models was failing. The code to
	  install a baseline evolution assumed that all installed apps would
	  have models defined, but this wasn't always true. We now handle this
	  case and just skip over such apps.


version 0.6.6 (1-April-2012):
	* Generate more accurate sample evolutions.

	  The sample evolutions generated with --hint should now properly
	  take into account import paths for third-party database modules.
	  Prior to this, such an evolution had to be modified by hand to
	  work.

	* Generate PEP-8-compliant sample evolutions.

	  The evolutions are now generated according to the standards of
	  PEP-8. This mainly influences blank lines around imports and the
	  grouping of imports.

	* Support Django 1.4's timezone awareness in the Version model.

	  The Version model was generating runtime warnings when creating an
	  instance of the Version model under Django 1.4, due to using
	  a naive (non-timezone-aware) datetime. We now try to use Django's
	  functionality for this, and fall back on the older methods for
	  older versions of Django.

version 0.6.5 (15-August-2011):
	* Fixed the version association for baseline evolutions for apps.

	  The new code for installing a baseline evolution for new apps in 0.6.4
	  was associating the wrong Version model with the Evolution. This doesn't
	  appear to cause any real-world problems, but it does make it harder
	  to see the proper evolution history in the database.

	* Added a built-in evolution to remove the Message model in Django 1.4 SVN.

	  Django 1.4 SVN removes the Message model from django.contrib.auth.
	  This would break evolutions, since there wasn't an evolution for this.
	  We now install one if we detect that the Message model is gone.


version 0.6.4 (22-June-2011):
	* Install a baseline evolution history for any new apps.

	  When upgrading an older database using Django Evolution when a new model
	  has been added and subsequent evolutions were made on that model, the
	  upgrade would fail. It would attempt to apply those evolutions on that
	  model, which, being newly created, would already have those new field
	  changes.

	  Now, like with an initial database, we install a baseline evolution
	  history for any new apps. This will ensure that those evolutions aren't
	  applied to the models in that app.

	* Fixed compatibility with Django SVN in the unit tests.

	  In Django SVN r16053, get_model() and get_models() only return installed
	  modules by default. This is calculated in part by a new
	  AppCache.app_labels dictionary, along with an existing
	  AppCache.app_store, neither of which we properly populated.

	  We now set both of these (though, app_labels only on versions of Django
	  that have it). This allows the unit tests to pass, both with older
	  versions of Django and Django SVN.


version 0.6.3 (9-May-2011):
	* Fixed multi-database support with different database backends.

	  The multi-database support only worked when the database backends
	  matched. Now it should work with different types. The unit tests have
	  been verified to work now with different types of databases.

	* Fixed a breaking with PostgreSQL when adding non-null columns with
	  default values. (Bugs #58 and #74)

	  Adding new columns that are non-null and have a default value would
	  break with PostgreSQL when the table otherwise had data in it. The
	  SQL for adding a column is an ALTER TABLE followed by an UPDATE to set
	  all existing records to have the new default value. PostgreSQL, however,
	  doesn't allow this within the same transaction.

	  Now we use two ALTER TABLEs. The first adds the column with a default
	  value, which should affect existing records. The second drops the
	  default. This should ensure that the tables have the data we expect
	  while at the same time keeping the field attributes the same as what
	  Django would generate.


version 0.6.2 (19-November-2010):
    * Add compatibility with Django 1.3.

      Django 1.3 introduced a change to the Session.expire_date field's
      schema, setting db_index to True. This caused Django Evolution to
      fail during evolution, with no way to provide an evolution file to
      work around the problem. Django Evolution now handles this by providing
      the evolution when running with Django 1.3 or higher.


version 0.6.1 (25-October-2010):
    * Fixed compatibility problems with both Django 1.1 and Python 2.4.


version 0.6.0 (24-October-2010):
    * Added support for Django 1.2's ability to use multiple databases.

      This should use the existing routers used in your project. By default,
      operations will happen on the 'default' database. This can be overridden
      during evolution by passing --database=dbname to the evolve command.

      Patch by Marc Bee and myself.


version 0.5.1 (13-October-2010):
    * Made the evolve management command raise CommandError instead of
      sys.exit on failure. This makes it callable from third party software.
      Patch by Mike Conley.

    * Made the evolve functionality available through an evolve() function
      in the management command, allowing the rest of the command-specific
      logic to be skipped (such as console output and prompting). Patch
      by Mike Conley.

    * Fixed incorrect defaults on SQLite when adding null fields. (Bug #49)

      On SQLite, adding a null field without a default value would cause the
      field name to be the default. This was due to attempting to select the
      field name from the temporary table, but since the table didn't exist,
      the field name itself was being used as the value.

      We are now more explicit about the fields being selected and populated.
      We have two lists, and no longer assume both are identical. We also use
      NULL columns for temporary table fields unconditionally.

      Patch by myself and Chris Beaven.


version 0.5.0 (18-May-2010):
    * Initial public release
